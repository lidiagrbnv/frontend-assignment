## Assignment

### Goal
The goal of this assignment is to have you work with the same tools that are used in every-day Movinga web development, so we can learn how you would perform while solving common development tasks that we have.

### Description
For this assignment, you are supposed to build a **user profile page**.

### Stack
At Movinga, our frontend stack consists of [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html) + [Redux](http://redux.js.org/), therefore it's required that the same stack is used in this assignment.

### Firebase
Firebase is also a part of our stack for some projects, hence we require that some features of Firebase are used in this assignment. There is a free-plan (default) that supports the requirements of this assignment (Hosting, Auth and real-time Database) and you should be able to start creating a project with your own Google account.

### Must have
- [ ] Sign-in/Sign-out functionality using [Firebase Auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/);
- [ ] Use **[Random User Generator](https://randomuser.me/)** and **Redux** to keep all the user data;
- [ ] Assign priority to a TO-DO and sort them by **highest to lowest priority**;
- [ ] Tests (Unit and/or Acceptance);
- [ ] Work on Chrome.

### Nice to have
- [ ] Responsive (Mobile and Web);
- [ ] Cross-browser support;
- [ ] UI following [Material Design concepts](https://material.io/)

## Hints
* You don't need to spend time creating a dev/build environment, using [react-create-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) (and other alike tools) is totally ok!
* Never done anything with Firebase? You can follow [this guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup) and it should give you a nice starting point.
* To find documentation and all necessary information about Randomuser, head here (https://randomuser.me/documentation#intro)
* You can use [Material-ui](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui) or any other of your choice, it has great integration with React environments.

## Instructions
On git platform of your choice (github, gitlab, bitbucket, etc) and copy this README into it. Feel free to edit it but it should contain must-have functionalities and stack.

**After you finished, you can share the repository URL with us. **

## Review

After you delivered the completed assignment to us, we will review it as soon as we can.

**We pay special attention to:**

* Coding skills
   * Writing testable code	
   * Whether you use Redux, React, HTML and CSS properly
* Software Engineering Skills
   * Code organization (modularity, dependencies between modules, naming, etc)
* Overall Feeling
   * Software usability
   * Assignment completion
   * Overall code quality (edge cases, usage of tools, performance, best practices)
